This step is executed first to save on computations in the case this condition is true, the rest of the code is not needed. Next, the inputs are converted to lowercase so they can be compared easily. Then, a for loop iterates each letter of the word and returns false if any letter is not found in the available letters. If these tests have been passed, then the only remaining condition is that the required letter is used. Therefore a for loop can be used to iterate through the word and return true if the required letter is present. After completing this iteration, false is returned as the required letter would not have been found.\n",

Since spelling bee uses 7 letters, a 4 letter word can not be a pangram so there is no need to check that for this case. Then, the code assigns a base score equal to the number of letters in the word. Finally, the code iterates through each letter of the available letters and returns the score if one is not found in the word. If the loop completes, it means that all available letters have been found in the word and the code returns the score plus 7."
